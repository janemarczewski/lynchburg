{"name":"Lynchburg","tagline":"","body":"Dear Lynchburg,\r\n\r\nI have a lot to thank you for. If only you could see the difference between who I was and who I am. For a long time, I've been a world-class people pleaser, always presenting the version of myself that was most likable, responsible, realistic.\r\n\r\nBut Lynchburg, you haven't allowed me to stay that way. I came into town in 2009, with the intent of becoming some kind of writer. No, a newscaster. Actually no, a teacher. A church-planter. A pastor's wife. Yeah, a pastor's wife.. I think.\r\n\r\nSee, I couldn't decide. And that's because in the deepest and most secret part of me, I knew precisely what I wanted. The problem was that it could never happen. It was silly. Illogical. Statistically unlikely. Realistically improbable.\r\n\r\nBut, Lynchburg, you helped me come around. I was inspired by you. Inspired by rain and strangers and front doors. I met people who didn't care if their dreams were far-fetched. I met people who liked it better that way.\r\n\r\nI was brought to life in a town full of dreamers who made me brave enough to share my voice. They told me that my songs mattered. I believed them. I believed you.\r\n\r\nAnd slowly, the vacuum-sealed and sterile version of me was seared open. I looked myself in the eyes with honesty--maybe for the first time--and found that at the heart of me I wanted to sing. And so the story has started.\r\n\r\nLife is too short not to do what you love. Lynchburg, you taught me that. And though these years have been the most difficult, they have been the most rewarding. It's not too late to do what you love. It's only the sunrise of our lives.\r\n\r\nOh, and I wrote a song for you.\r\n\r\nLove Always,\r\n\r\nJane","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
